//! Arena presence — `GET /arena/presence`, public and unauthenticated.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Asked for by the owner: a front-page panel showing how many people are in the
//! arena right now and when they usually are, so a player can tell whether it is
//! worth queueing, and so the project can show publicly that it is live.
//!
//! # Where the numbers come from
//!
//! `arena_matches`, which the matchmaker writes one row to per ticket:
//! `(ticket_id, user_id, status, paired, recorded_at, resolved_at)`. It is the
//! **human-only** source — a bot never POSTs `matches/create`, so every row is a
//! real person. Indexed on `recorded_at DESC`, which is what every query here
//! sorts and filters on.
//!
//! # What "now" honestly means
//!
//! These are recent-activity windows, not socket counts, and the field names say
//! so. The exact live figure — connected ENet peers — lives in a `HashMap` local
//! to the ENet thread and would need a shared atomic to publish; that is a
//! worthwhile follow-up, not a reason to ship nothing.
//!
//! * `in_match_recent`  — distinct users whose ticket resolved to `matched`
//!   inside [`MATCH_WINDOW_MIN`]. A match runs a few minutes, so this is a good
//!   proxy for "fighting right now".
//! * `queuing_recent` — distinct users with an unresolved `searching` ticket
//!   inside [`QUEUE_WINDOW_MIN`], the five minutes the owner asked for.
//!
//! The window matters for a reason visible in the data: 48 of the 458 tickets on
//! record are unresolved `searching` rows going back to June — abandoned
//! searches. Counting "unresolved" without a time bound would report dozens of
//! people queuing forever.
//!
//! # Expectations
//!
//! Sixteen distinct users have ever queued and it is usually one at a time, so
//! this panel will read 0 or 1 most of the time. That is the honest picture, and
//! a heatmap of 58 days of real history is the part with something to say.
