//! The grade retail rolled on Sigil-shop arcane gear.
//!
//! THE BUG (#167). Ninety global-shop offers carry `arcaneTier > 0` and an EMPTY
//! authored `grading`: retail rolled the grade when you bought the item, and the
//! APK records only that a roll happens, never its outcome.
//! `grant_from_offer_contents` refused those rather than hand an ungraded item to
//! someone who paid, so most of the Sigil shop could not be bought at all.
//!
//! WHAT THIS IS, AND IS NOT. It is the distribution of OUTCOMES retail produced,
//! not retail's rule. The rule existed only in the server being replaced and is
//! not recoverable from anything we hold. The reporter was told that explicitly
//! and asked for the distribution anyway, which is the right call: an item whose
//! grade is drawn from what retail really handed out is closer to the game than
//! an item nobody can buy.
//!
//! 243 grants over 19 of the 90 offers, keyed by `arcaneTier` because that is the
//! only feature the outcomes separate on. The ungraded outcome is kept and drawn
//! like any other — 111 of the 235 arcane-tier-2 grants carried no grade at all,
//! so removing it would make every purchase graded, which retail's was not.
//!
//! The GRADING property DEFINITION ids are real, taken from the captured grants.
//! An earlier cut of the corpus stored only the tiers, which would have left this
//! module inventing ids for properties that have to name a specific bonus.
//!
//! WHY THE DRAW IS NOT DETERMINISTIC, unlike dungeon loot. A dungeon is described
//! to the client in advance and must still hold the same thing when opened, so
//! those rolls are seeded. A purchase has no such requirement: the response IS
//! the grant, and retail rolled afresh every time. Buying the same offer twice
//! should be able to give two different grades, which is the whole complaint.
